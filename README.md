# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
 This is a computer vision-based project that detects signs of driver drowsiness using facial landmarks. When the system detects sleepiness (such as closed eyes for too long), it triggers an alarm sound to alert the driver.

## Features
 Real-time monitoring of driver's eye movements through webcam  
Detects drowsiness using Eye Aspect Ratio(EAR)  
Uses OpenCV, dlib, and facial landmarks  
Alerts driver with a alarm sound when drowsiness is detected  
Basic frontend UI built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  

## Technologies Used
 **Python** – for backend logic and drowsiness detection  
**OpenCV** – for real-time video processing  
**Dlib** – for facial landmark detection  
**imutils** – for image processing helper functions  
**Pygame** – to play alarm/buzzer sound when drowsiness is detected  
**HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – for the frontend user interface
