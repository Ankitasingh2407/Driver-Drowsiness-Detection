# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
 This is a computer vision-based project that detects signs of driver drowsiness using facial landmarks. When the system detects sleepiness (such as closed eyes for too long), it triggers an alarm sound to alert the driver.

## Features
 Real-time monitoring of driver's eye movements through webcam  
Detects drowsiness using Eye Aspect Ratio(EAR)  
Uses OpenCV, dlib, and facial landmarks  
Alerts driver with a alarm sound when drowsiness is detected  
Basic frontend UI built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  

## Technologies Used
 Python – for backend logic and drowsiness detection  
OpenCV – for real-time video processing  
dlib – for facial landmark detection  
imutils – for image processing helper functions  
Pygame – to play alarm/buzzer sound when drowsiness is detected  
HTML, CSS, JavaScript – for the frontend user interface
